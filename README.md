If you're trying to become a SOC analyst, network analysis is one of those skills that not many people have unfortunately and many people get pretty intimidated when presented with a pcap, a packet capture. 
  

Let's get started start by heading over to Cyber Defenders and create an account if you haven't already. Once you log in, you want to select "BlueYard Labs". Go over to practice. Then, you want to look for the lab called "Hawkeye". You will see the platform rules if this is your first time using Cyber Defenders. We can click on accept and proceed.

Let's head over to "Details". Scroll down, and you are given a scenario, "An accountant at your organization received an email regarding an invoice with a download link. Suspicious network traffic was observed shortly after opening the email. As a SOC analyst, investigate the network trace and analyze exfiltration attempts." Now with the tools provided, this is what we can use to go ahead and analyze this pcap.

In our case, I'm going to be only utilizing Wireshark and maybe even VirusTotal. From this scenario, we can already guess that there is going to be some sort of exfiltration attempt, maybe via email. Let's join the lab and then download lab files. You'll get a warning here that says that this is real malware, so just please be careful. Make sure that you utilize a virtual machine, just in case.

Once the file is finished downloading, we'll have to extract the pcap using the password "cyberdefender.org". Right-click and click on "Extract All...". Then, I'll type in the password "cyberdefenders.org". If for whatever reason you forget the password, you can find the password on the site itself. If you have Wireshark installed, you should see a pcap icon that we can just double-click.

Let's first start off with our statistics to see the duration of the capture. So we'll click on "Statistics". Click on "Capture File Properties". If we look at the time elapsed, we can see that it took around an hour and 3 minutes. Where the first packet was at '20:37:07', which is 8:37 p.m. UTC. The last packet was up until '21:40:48', which is 9:40 p.m.

The next thing we want to do is take a look at the protocol hierarchy. To do that, we need to click on "Statistics". Click on "Protocol Hierarchy" and we'll see a bunch of protocols here. Now there's SMB, SMTP, Kerberos, HTTP, and many many more. Let's go ahead and close that out and put that in our notes.

Now let's see the top talkers. Let's take a look at that by clicking on "Statistics" and click on "Conversations". Click on the ipv4 tab since we want to see the top talkers for ipv4 addresses. We'll sort it by bytes. At the very top, we see an external IP address that could be of interest. That is '217.182.138.150', so let's take note of that and also let's track the top three IPS.

Next is the TCP tab. I'm going to sort it by bytes, just like what I did before. Now we do see some port '80' traffic, which should be HTTP. That's not always the case, but typically it is. We see '445', which is SMB. Then, we see '443', which is HTTPS. Finally, we also see SMTP traffic on port '587'.

So '23.229.162.69' is likely our mail server. Scrolling a little bit down, we see port '389', which is LDAP. Then, we see port '88', which is Kerberos as well. I'll head over to UDP next. Sort it by bytes one more time. Now we see some multicast traffic with NetBIOS, NTP, DNS, DHCP and many more.

Go ahead and close that out. As a starting point, I'm interested in our top talker. So let's go ahead and filter for that. I'll type in "ip.addr == 217.182.138.150". Then, hit "Enter". We see that on packet number '210', there is a HTTP packet that occurred on '20:37:54'. 

Let's follow it by right-clicking. Click on "Follow". Select "HTTP stream". Now inside of this packet, we see a binary being downloaded as we can tell by the file header of "MZ" and the content type of "application/x-msdownload". We can extract this file later and perform some additional OSINT, open source intelligence, to hopefully get some additional context into what this file might be.

However, before we do that, let's determine how our internal IP address communicated with this external IP. So I'll go ahead and close this out. Let's take a look at the first packet, which is '207'. We want to see what happened prior to this packet. So let's go ahead and remove the TCP stream filter and hit "Enter". 

Looking at packet '206', we see a DNS response from our server back to our internal IP of '132'. Now if we were to just scroll over just a little bit, we can see that there was a standard query response for the domain of "proforma-invoices.com". This could be the suspicious download link that was hinted in the scenario. So let's keep note of this domain.

Scrolling up just a little bit, we see some SMB traffic. I am interested in the SMTP traffic since we know that this protocol exists and the scenario specifically mentioned email. So let's click on the filter and then type in "SMTP" and hit "Enter". Here we see a lot of SMTP traffic that begins on '20:38:16'. Which again is '8:38' PM. With the first packet being '3175'.

If you recall, the first activity with our top talk talker of '217.182.138.150' started on packet number '207'. So this SMTP traffic happened afterward. Looking back at our scenario, the accountant received the email regarding an invoice with a download link and unfortunately, this pcap does not seem to contain that email based on our search, but that is okay.

We will instead assume that the link was "proforma-invoices.com". Which was the domain that our internal IP requested and got a response from. Let's go ahead and right-click the first packet of '3175'. Click on "Follow". Select "TCP stream". We can see that the host name of the mail server is "secureserver.net", and the software version of "Exim 4.91".

We can also see that our client's machine is "Beijing-5cd1-PC" with a public IP of '173.66.146.112'. There is an authentication attempt using the user and password. Now these are likely encoded using "base64" and one quick way to tell is by looking at the padding at the end. If you see equal signs, that could be base64, but keep in mind that even if you do see an equal sign at the end it doesn't always mean it is base 64. However, you can always try and decode it.

To decode this, I'll go ahead and copy the base64 log-on. Then I'll head over to CyberChef. So in CyberChef, I'll go ahead and paste in that username, and then from the left, I'll select from base64 as I want to decode this text. So I'll just go ahead and double-click it and at the bottom of the output, we can see that the username is "sales.del@macwinlogistics.in".

Now let's go ahead and do the same for the password. So I'll select the password and copy it. Then, I'll paste it into CyberChef and I see that the password is "Sales@23". This is likely the account of our attacker. So what can do is perform some OSINT on the domain of our attacker. The last thing is to put that in our notes since that is an activity that we'll do later.

Let's take a look at the subject as well, since I notice that this is encoded with base64. So I'll copy the subject up to the question mark. Typically a question mark represents something else. I'll paste that in. So now we see our subject of "Hawkeye Keylogger - Reborn v9 - Passwords Logs". So we know that this is already a bad day...

It appears that our user of "roman.mcguire" was most likely the victim or the user account for "BEIJING-5CD1-PC". Probably, Roman's passwords were stolen based on the subject line. Now let's go back over to our pcap and look at the content itself. As we can see, it is also encoded using base64.

Another quick way of telling if it is encoded using base64, is looking at the context transfer encoding. It tells you that it is encoded using base64. So let's go ahead and copy out the contents. Head back over into CyberChef and paste that in. Look at that, nice. So we see a username as "roman.mcguire914@aol.com". Then, we see the password as well.

Now looking at the contents, we do know that all of the passwords stored on Roman's computer were scrapped, and these contents were apparently sent on '20:38:16'. Let's filter for SMTP and see when was the last activity. So let's scroll all the way down. So the last activity happened on '21:40:04', that is 9:40 p.m. UTC time.

I'll go ahead and right-click that. Click on "Follow". Select "TCP stream". The reason why I'm doing this is I want to see if any additional files had been exfiltrated. Now I'll copy the contents here and head back over to CyberChef to see if there's something different. By the looks of it, it seems to be the same. There are three passwords here or three credentials.

Now I guess the next thing we can do is export the file that we found in the beginning and generate a file hash on it to perform some additional OSINT. So let's go ahead and do that. Before we export the file we will likely need to disable defender just in case it does detect the m and block it so I'll go ahead and disable the fender first click on manage settings and then I'll disable realtime protection and if you are following along this is a good time to remind you again to make sure that you're using a virtual machine because mistakes do happen and sometimes we do silly things so let's click on file export objects and click on HTTP and then we want to look for the domain performa Das invoices is and this is it TK raore protected 99. exe that sounds like a legitimate file name let's go ahead and select save and I'll save this with the extension ofm again we do make mistakes and we do sometimes execute things we don't want to now this is also interesting we also see bot. what is my IP address.com happening quite frequently this gives me an idea that maybe just maybe that once executing this Mau or this executable it makes a scheduled query out to what is my IP to determine hey if my IP changed at least now I know so now that we have our file downloaded let's open up Powershell and then I will type in get- file hash and then type in our file of interest and that is our Shaw 256 hash so let's go ahead and copy that out and we'll use the best tool ever which is virus total click on search and then I'll paste in our file hash that we generated and look at that that is a super safe file with 57 vendors detected as Trojan Auto it/ gen 8 is the popular threat label and the threat category is Trojan family label as Auto it gen 8 and Hawkeye we see 15 plus comments under the community so let's go ahead and click on that and scrolling down we see 16 comments let's see verdict malicious okay uh malicious yeah malicious okay yeah that's good to know let's scroll back up and then select relations I want to take a look at the contacted domains and look at that and this is the reason why I wanted to know if this executable was responsible for querying what is my IP address because if you recall under the wi shark export we see a bunch of scheduled or at least I assume it's a scheduled query outbound to what is my IP address.com and looking at virus total we can tell that it does actually contact the domain bot. what is my IP address.com so this confirms my assumption that this executable does indeed call out to that domain if we click on details we can take a look at the creation time of this malware which is over here and the creation time of the malware was back on 2019 April ail 10th at 4:43 UTC time which was on the same day our accountant or at least this accountant reported this activity next let's start performing some open source Intelligence on the top talker IP and domain we'll start off with the IP address of 21718 21381 15 I'll be using abuse ipdb we can see that the ISP the internet service provider is over VH SAS with the usage type of a data center web hosting and Transit it is also located in the country of France abuse ipdb did not find this IP in their database now if we were to look at virus total we can see that four vendors had flagged this as malicious next we'll take a look at the Domain itself pro-in for this I will use a who is lookup by domain tools and then I'll paste in the domain and hit search and we see that performa dasin voices.com is for sale so unfortunately with a free account we cannot see the history of this domain but we can see two changes on two unique IP addresses over 5 years maybe something to note back in virus total I'll do the same and we can see 12 vendors reported this as malicious and some as fishing the next thing I want to take a look at that is the email domain from the attacker if you recall their email address was sales. Dell macwin logistics. so I'll go ahead and type in macwin logistics. and perform some ENT on that so there's no reports on virus total but there is at least 10 detected files communicating with this domain and scrolling down we do see some Hawkeye writeups next I'll utilize who is lookup from domain tools and we can see that this domain is for sale as well similar to the other one now we can start building our findings and report it to whoever needs to know on April 10th 2019 at 203754 UTC time the user had accessed the site Profforino and requested the file named TK raore protected 99. exe based on open source intelligence this file is classified as a Trojan with a Mau label of Hawkeye Hawkeye is a Mau family that is known for its key logger capabilities Hawkeye is usually delivered via fishing and this file is known to query a site called what is my IP address.com and evidence shows that the host beijing--5cd 1-pc was seen querying the site what is my IP address.com at 2038 15 immediately there was communication towards a mail server at 2322916269 which an account of sales. Dell macwin logistics. was used to authenticate at 203816 contents containing passwords related to Roman Maguire were seen being sent to the email address of sales. Dell mawin logistics. the same content containing passwords was sent again to the same email at 23843 and the last male activity occurred on 21404 based on our evidence the total duration of compromise appears to be between 20 3754 to 2144 which is 1 Hour 2 minutes and 10 seconds it is important to take a step back and recap your investigation every now and then especially if you are performing an investigation that involves multiple machines because it can get pretty overwhelming especially if you don't take any notes now let's finish this up by completing the questions on Cyber Defenders how many packets does the capture have we can do this by going over to wire shark going to statistics capture file properties and then under packets captured we see 403 so the answer answer to this would be 403 at what time was the first packet captured so again we can go back into our capture file properties and look under the first packet this is the time that we want to copy and just looking at the format at the very end it has three characters so I'm assuming it is wanting to include UTC the time zone what is the duration of the capture head back over to the file properties and we see the duration of 1 Hour 3 minutes and 41 seconds copy that paste that in there what is the most active computer at the link level link level is Layer Two so your Mac address we can get this information by clicking on statistics conversations and then we can copy the value of address a I'll paste that in manufacturer of the nick of the most active system at the link layer now if we look at our layer 2 address you want to take the first three bytes of the MAC address which in this case is 00802 and then search up wire shark oui as this will provide you with a lookup to see what the vendor is for this Nick and then we see that it's hulet Packard AKA HP and it seems that the format wants a dash so I'll type in a dash where is the headquarter of the company that manufactured the nick of the most active computer at the link level I'll just type in hulet Packard and I'll type in headquarters we see the company headquartered in Paulo Alto California so that is likely the answer here Paulo Alto question number seven the organization works with private addressing and netmask of sl24 how many computers in the organization are involved in the capture we can find this out by click on statistics click on end points go over to ipv4 and then I'll sort it by address just to make sure all of the internal private IP addresses are at the top and we can see that there is a 10. 4.10.2 so this is likely 1.4 2132 so three and then we see at 255 and this is a broadcast address so that will not count so I am going to say that there are three host or at least three computers in this case and that is correct nice what is the name of the most active computer at the network level if you recall when we followed the SMTP traffic we saw that the host name was Beijing Das something Beijing D5 cd1 DPC so I'll go ahead and paste that in there what is the IP of the organization's DNS server to find this answer we can go ahead and search up and filter DNS and we want to look at the responses is which in this case is responding from The Source Port of 53 and we can see that this traffic here is responding to 132 which is our internal IP so we can infer that 104104 is our DNS server 104104 what domain is the victim asking about in packet 204 well let's go ahead and check that out I'll remove DNS and look at 204 so this is the packet 20 204 and then scrolling right a bit we see that it is querying pro-in voices.com pro-in voices.com beautiful question 11 what is the IP of the domain in the previous question now if we see the response from that DNS we can just expand answers and then we see the address of 2171 1821 38150 so that is going to to be the IP address of our domain of Interest question number 12 indicate the country to which the IP in the previous section belongs now we did some ENT earlier and we found out that this was located in France what operating system does the victim's computer run on ooh this one's interesting so how to find this is we can use user agents and to find that we got to look for HTTP traffic so we can just go ahead and filter for HTTP right click follow HTTP stream and now we'll look at the host request so what is it requesting to the server and that we can see that it's using a user agent of Mozilla 4.0 and of course user agents can be spoofed but in this case I don't think it will go that far we can see that it's using Windows NT 6.1 copy that and I'll paste that as the answer now you can go ahead and do some searches on Google Google for Windows NT 6.1 and just to see what operating system that is so if I do a control F NT 6.1 I see that it is under Windows 7 and we also have three more values here so Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows multipoint Server 2010 and 2011 what is the name of the malicious file downloaded by the accountant so we know that the file was downloaded via http p and we can see that it was requested up here and the file name is TK raore protected 99 what is the md5 hash of the downloaded file now we can do this two ways we can do this via Powershell because we did extract that file we can type in get- file hash but this time we'll specifically mention the algorithm algorithm as md5 and then we get our nd5 5 HH the second way of doing it is looking at virus total let's copy the Sha 256 hash click on details I would find the md5 hash right here so we can copy that out and paste that into to our answers what software runs the web server that hosts the malware okay let's go back into our HTTP traffic and we want to look for the software that the server responded with and I see that there is a server light speed so we can go ahead and copy that out and hit submit perfect if we don't know what light speed is we can type in light speed web server and we see it is an Apache alternative what is the public IP of the victim's computer this we can take a look at SMTP if you recall we did see a public IP of 17366 14612 and paste it in in which country is the email server to which the store stolen information is sent I'm guessing this question is asking where is the email server located we do know that the email server had an IP address of 23. something so let's take a look at it so 23229 do1 16269 again if you were taking notes you can find that in your notes I'll use a different resource called ipinfo.io and then I'll paste in the IP address and we can see the country is located at in the US so the United States type in United States question 19 analyzing the first extraction of information what software runs the email server to which the stolen data is sent we can take a look at the SMTP traffic and then we see that there is a software called XM 4.91 this is going to be it I believe question 20 to which email account is the stolen information sent head back over to our sntp traffic and we see sales. Dell macwin logistics. so I'll go ahead and copy that out what is the password used by the Mau to send the email again to find this we can copy the password head over to cyberchef I'll just add a new input for now and then throw that in there and our password is sales at 23 with a capital s sales at 23 which maare variant exfiltrated the data ooh Mau variant so if we go back into our cyberchef if you recall the subject line or at least in this content it shows us as well we see hawkey key logger reborn v9 so this is likely the variant of this Hawkeye key logger so I'll just type it in reborn v9 what are the Bank of America access credentials username colon password let's take a look at our contents scroll down over to Bank of America and we see that the username is roman. Maguire with this super trusty password so I will go ahead and paste that in and the password itself nice and the last question how many minutes does the collected data get exfiltrated well we know that the same contents were exfiltrated twice we can take the first time and then subtract it from the second time the content was exfiltrated so we go back over to our peap file we can right click follow TCP stream and then select the contents we see that the content was exfiltrated on packet 3196 at 20 3816 so then we can also see that it shows a data fragment so let's go back and filter for SMTP and then look for the next data fragment that is not under 203816 and then here is the next data fragment at 20 4821 so that's about 10 minutes and out of curiosity if I were to scroll down just a bit we see another data fragment at 205825 so it seems to be happening every 10 minutes so let's go ahead and type in 10 and hit submit perfect we just completed this together hopefully you have learned a lot from this video and are becoming more confident in your ability in performing network analysis from a pcap if you aren't aware I am in the middle of creating a course and if you enjoyed this level of detail and instructions then you will absolutely love my course this course is going to be tailored for those who are wanting to become a sock analyst and also for those that are already in the sock and just want to level up their skills you can sign up for the wait list by clicking on the link down below that is it for the video and I hope you found that informative if you did let me know by hitting that like button and subscribe if you want to remember to stay curious and do things differently
